-- This migration ensures the core database schema is in place

-- Enable necessary extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pg_trgm";

-- Core tables should already exist, but this migration is a placeholder
-- to satisfy the migration system that expects this file.
-- Most tables are created by Drizzle ORM schema.

-- Add any additional indexes or constraints if needed
-- (This migration primarily exists to resolve the missing file error)

SELECT 1; -- Simple no-op query to make this a valid migration
